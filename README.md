# tips2
This is a second go-round on the pre-homework assignment for the CodePath Swift for Designers course. I added some design and functional details. 

The app allows you to enter a bill total, select a tip amount and see the total amount owed. 

Time spent: 5+hrs

Completed user stories: 
- Changed colors, fonts and layouts
- Display total amount for split bill between 2-4 people
- View a total amount due
- Can clear the bill amount field with X
- Added title bar

Issues:
- First app started freezing on the launch screen once I finished code adjustments. I was unable to de-bug and had to completely re-do from scratch.
- Second build of app built successfully then crashed when keyboard was used; I had to de-bug and partially re-build the app
- I could not figure out animations or transitions
- I could not figure out how to include the dollar sign in the empty form field
